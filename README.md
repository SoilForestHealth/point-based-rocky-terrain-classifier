<h1>Rocky Terrain Prediction</h1>
</div>

## Aim

To predict the presence of rocky terrain using topography and remote sensing data. This information includes:

1. Topography Features (aspect, elevation, flow length, plan curvature, profile curvature, slope, tan curvature, twi)

2. Remote Sensing Features (vegetation index, moisture index, bulk density, soil organic carbon, clay, sand)

## Environment Setup

```bash

git clone https://github.com/SoilForestHealth/rocky-terrain-classifier.git

```

- Install all packages in the ```requirements.txt``` file.

```bash
